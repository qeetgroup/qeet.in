        question: "What is Qeet Group?",
        answer:
          "A multi-company holding built to start, support, and grow ventures that take long-term bets on questions worth answering. Each subsidiary is operated independently. They share a philosophy, a quality standard, and a refusal to ship work the team cannot defend — they do not share a roadmap, a thesis, or an org chart.",
      },
      {
        question: "How is the Group structured?",
        answer:
          "As a holding company with operating subsidiaries. Each venture is its own company with its own team, its own product, and its own runway. The Group provides capital, a philosophy, a network, and a quality bar — and then gets out of the way.",
      },
      {
        question: "Where is Qeet Group based?",
        answer:
          "Remote-first. The Group's small operating team works distributed; individual ventures choose what makes sense for them.",

  },
  {
    heading: "Capital and ventures",
    items: [
      {
        question: "Are you accepting pitches or applications from founders?",
        answer:
          "Not in an open, unsolicited way. The Group starts and operates its own ventures rather than running a fund. If you have a venture you'd want to build inside the Group, the right path is to write to partnerships@qeet.in and tell us what you'd build and why now.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do you take outside LP capital?",
        answer:
          "No. Qeet Group is not currently raising LP capital and is not structured as a fund. If this changes, it will be announced in the newsroom.",
      },
      {
        question: "What stage do you back?",
        answer:
          "We start ventures rather than fund them. The Group incubates and operates subsidiaries from inception. We do not lead seed or Series A rounds in external companies.",
      },
      {
        question: "What sectors are you focused on?",
        answer:
          "Sector is downstream of question. We back companies that begin from genuinely ambitious questions — across domains. The current focus is identity and access (Qeet ID); future ventures will be announced as they take shape.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do subsidiaries ever fail or get sold?",
        answer:
          "They might. The Group is structured to give ventures the patience to chase the right answer over years — but patience is not a guarantee. If a venture cannot reach the quality bar, we close it deliberately and write about why. If a sale is the right outcome for the people and the work, we'd consider it. Neither is the default.",

    heading: "Working with us",

      {
        question: "Are you hiring?",

          "Not actively, but we're always interested in senior operators considering joining a young multi-company holding. Write to careers@qeet.in with what you've shipped that you're proud of and which venture you'd want to work inside. See the Careers page for what we look for.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do partnerships work?",
        answer:
          "Partnerships happen at the venture level, not the Group level — each subsidiary handles its own customer, channel, and integration partnerships. For Group-level discussions (corporate partnerships, co-investing alongside us in a venture, joint ventures), write to partnerships@qeet.in.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long do you take to respond?",

          "We aim to respond to direct inquiries within a few business days. Press inquiries usually get the fastest turnaround.",

  {
    heading: "Press and media",
    items: [

        question: "Where do I find logos and brand assets?",

          "The press kit page has wordmarks, the mark, and a one-paragraph fact sheet. Please don't recolor the marks or pair them with messaging that misrepresents the Group.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are interviews and quotes available?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Write to press@qeet.in with the angle, the publication, and the deadline. We try to respond within two business days.",
